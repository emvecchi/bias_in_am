I think the most insulting thing about being called a girl for a boy is the affront to his own identity. He is being called something he is not. He doesn't think its insulting because he hates girls and thinks they're inferior, but rather because his identity as a boy is being taken away. # None
I'm not some hippy liberal christian, I'm a serious southern baptist Sunday school teacher. I think that after examining the Bible, there is no argument that being transgender is wrong. Indeed, there are only three main prongs of attack, all of which are incorrect. # None
None of these imply that being transgender it's self is in any way wrong. It is always something else that commonly goes along with transgender issues that makes it wrong. # None
For example, (SPOILERS ME3) seeing Wrex grow from a mere gun-for-hire in ME1 to the responsible, yet still badass leader of the Genophage-free Krogan in ME3 was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career. Similarly, the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch, thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for /r/frission material. # None

Specifically in the case with women, many of my female friends, including my girlfriend (hence the throwaway) , have posted nudes and any time I ask them why, they somehow defend it with "it makes me feel good."  Of course, I ask them why it makes them feel good and most either don't have an answer or somehow deay it makes them feel empowered as a woman who is proud of her body.  I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense. # None
The internet has seemingly opposed targeted marketing immensely-the use of cookies, search history, and other means to figure out a users interests generates a lot of privacy concerns. # None
Quick disclaimer before I start, I have not yet used OKCupid, nor have I used any dating service. I'm not overweight(130 lbs 5"9 male), nor do I have any serious imperfections. I'm by no means attractive(I wear glasses and I don't lift much), but I'm not horribly ugly either.  Only saying this because I don't want to sound like some SJW that's upset that they're ugly and oppressed or some shit. Probably shouldn't have to say this though since the /r/changemyview community is *usually* pretty mature with their responses. # male
I'm a 25 year old white guy and straight, I've been single for about 2 years now and before that I was in a relationship for 4 and a half years. I think this is where I started to get bitter. I fell into depression after I broke up with her for sending messages to other guys suggesting she would met up with them for sex. I stumbled across some messages implying she already had but I have no solid evidence. I was a broken man at that point, I don't know how best to describe it, my inner self was shattered. I think I was like that for about 6-8 months but its hard to remember, all the days just blurred together. She had a new boyfriend in less than a week. I hated the fact that she could just be with someone else so soon more than I hated myself for being so God damn pathetic. I also hated that she told people that I was cheating on her and that I had "other girls on the go the whole time". I still had her on Facebook at this point and all the guys commenting where the guys she was sending messages to. "Aw don't worry about it babe he was a dick anyway. Do you need a hug? ;)" where among the comments she got, and it goes without saying that this brought my blood to boil. # guy
I'm a 33 year old male and I eventually want to have a happy family and children. Although I'm in no rush, I have been getting more serious about it recently, and really thinking about whats important to me. I have concluded that looks are the most important thing to me in a mate, not because I am superficial or shallow, but because I believe that looks are the best indicator of ones overall health, intellect, and the types of choices they make. Let me elaborate... # male
