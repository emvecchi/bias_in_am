% im plicitly consented to sexual activity by largely irrelevant factors such as mode of dress promiscuity being alone or area in which one was assaulted ex alone at bar since men are usually not sexualized in manner that contributes to these perceptions and finally i think marginalization over concern of sexual assault would lessen because it would be seen as broad social ill rather than woman
I think having male victims come forward would achieve a number of things:  first, and rather unfortunately, I think having a male voice would serve to 'legitimize' the crime; second,  I think people would stop questioning the extent to which a victim contributed or otherwise "implicitly consented" to the sexual activity by largely irrelevant factors such as mode of dress, promiscuity, being alone, or the area in which one was assaulted (ex. alone at a bar), since men are usually not sexualized in the manner that contributes to these perceptions; and finally,  I think the marginalization over the concern of sexual assault would lessen because it would be seen as a broad social ill rather than a "woman's issue." # None
